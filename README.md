# Not-Awesome-Articulation-Reconstruction-Papers

This is a repo that collects some works about **articulated object reconstruction** (and **interactive perception** perhaps).

Papers are awesome, I am not, so do my repo. 

Can affordance prediction be counted as articulation reconstruction?ðŸ¤”

- This paper propose a pre-trained model to reconstruct articulated physical objects from unknown categories. based on the point cloud of the object before and after interaction based on point segmentation. It can divide object into 1 static part 1 moving part, and a revolute or prismatic joint.
