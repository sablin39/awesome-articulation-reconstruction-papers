# Not-Awesome-Articulation-Reconstruction-Papers

This is a repo that collects some works about **articulated object reconstruction** (and **interactive perception** perhaps).

Papers are awesome, I am not, so do my repo. 

Can affordance prediction be counted as articulation reconstruction?ðŸ¤”

- This paper propose a pre-trained model to reconstruct articulated physical objects from unknown categories. based on the point cloud of the object before and after interaction based on point segmentation. It can divide object into 1 static part 1 moving part, and a revolute or prismatic joint.

- This paper proposed an approach to reconstruct articulated objects based on interactive perception. It takes observation as input and performs affordance prediction to choose an interaction point. Then by performing the interaction the articulation inference gets the observation before and after interaction, which are used to form the articulation model along with contact region. However there are no planning module for embodied AI in this paper, agents are teleported to the interaction point.
